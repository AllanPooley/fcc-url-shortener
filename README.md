## Synopsis

This microservice allows you generate an alternate URL to access your favourite place on the web. An alternate URL that is hopefully shorter than the original!

## API Usage

`https://fcc-url-shortener-allanpooley.c9users.io/new/http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774981-waking-up`

## Expected Outputs

`{"original_url":"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774981-waking-up","short_url":"https://fcc-url-shortener-allanpooley.c9users.io/5"}`


## Accessing Save URLs

Simply use the returned 'short_url' to access the URL you saved:

`https://fcc-url-shortener-allanpooley.c9users.io/5`


## Motivation

I've developed this microservice simply as a learning exercise to build web apps using the MERN stack. I study at freeCodeCamp!
